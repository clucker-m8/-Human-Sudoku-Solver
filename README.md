# -Human-Sudoku-Solver
This is a unique sudoku solver written in python, which avoids brute solving algorithms at all costs, and solves sudokus which range from simple to advanced (9x9 grids only).
Contributions may be accepted, I do preffer to work solo but, seeing github more extensively, the community tends to come up with really well-writen code/consepts. I admire that.

If interested, do look at the lof file, as it will have my intentions on what is to come, and summaries of what has been constructed up to a most recent point.
Thank you for showing interest!
